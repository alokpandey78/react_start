Framework Vs. Library

>Angular is a complete framework while React is a JavaScript Library.
>Angular uses a two-directional data flow process where it updates the Real DOM directly while React updates only 
the Virtual DOM and is concerned with the one-directional data flow
>While React can be bundled with other programming libraries, Angular is a complete solution in itself
>For uni-directional data flow, React needs to be augmented by Redux.

Scalability:
>Angular is easy to scale its design as well as a powerful CLI. React is testable and therefore scalable compared to other frameworks.

Computed Properties:
>As far as performance is concerned, plain getters in Angular are out of the scenario because they get called on each render.
It is however possible to use BehaviorSubject from RsJS.
React allows the use of @computed from MobX â€“ achieving the same objective but with a nicer API

Simplicity + Code length
>React is quite easy and simple to understand but it takes quite some time to set up a project in React.
Angular is not simple by any means. Its inherent complexity sometimes causes confusion and Angular specific 3rd party libraries and syntax.
